These are the commands I know of:

	Permission: Everyone

	help(commandName)
	listRaids
	raidAdd(raid, raidSpot, role)
	raidReserves(raid)
	raidRemove(raid)
	raidFill(raid, intervals)
			

	Permission: Officers

	newRaid(raid)
	deleteRaid(raid)
	raidSetup(raid, day, date, time, timezone)
	raidAdd(raid, raidSpot, role, discordName)
	raidReserves(raid, discordName)
	raidRemove(raid, discordName)

Note: 
1. All commands should be executed using the prefix. 
2. All commands are case-sensitive.
3. All arguments are seperated by spaces.
