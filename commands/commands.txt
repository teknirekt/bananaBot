raidRemove(raidName)	

Permission: Officers

newRaid(raidName)
deleteRaid(raidName)
raidSetup(raidName, day, date, time, timezone)
raidFill(raidName, intervals, discordName)
raidReserves(raidName, discordName)

Note: 
1. All commands should be executed using the prefix. 
2. All arguments are seperated by spaces.
