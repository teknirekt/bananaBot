This bot was written as a hobby project specifically for BNN, to help ease the "paperwork" for the guild. I'd like to hand out a special thanks to BNN for being an awesome guild, this is my gift to you!
Source code will definitely be available some day (when I learn how to gitHub)...

If you have any ideas, feedback, or find any bugs, be sure to let me know on discord @XLOlsen#5081.
